# Customer Check-In System

This project implements a simple **Customer Check-In** form using Java Swing for a hotel management system. The form allows users to input their details, select room preferences, and check-in to a hotel room. It is designed with a GUI-based interface, where users can fill out personal and room-related details.

## Features:
- **Personal Information:** Name, Mobile Number, Nationality, Gender, Email, ID Proof, Address.
- **Room Information:** Room Type, Bed Type, Room Number, and Price.
- **Buttons:** 
  - "Clear" to reset the form.
  - "Alot Room" to confirm room allocation with a success message.
  
## Components Used:
- **Swing Components:** `JTextField`, `JComboBox`, `JLabel`, `JButton`, and `JOptionPane` for alert dialogs.
- **Layouts:** The form uses the `AbsoluteLayout` for manual positioning of components.
  
## How to Run:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Make sure you have JDK 8 or later installed on your machine.
2. **IDE (Optional):** You can use any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for development and running the code.

### Steps to Run:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/CustomerCheckIn.git
Navigate to the directory where CustomerCheckIn.java is located.

Compile the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac CustomerCheckIn.java
Run the program:

bash

java CustomerCheckIn

How it Works:
Personal Details:

The user is asked to input their Name, Mobile Number, Nationality, Gender, and Email.
There are text fields for entering information and a combo box for selecting Gender.
Room Selection:

The user can choose a Room Type (e.g., AC or Non-AC), Bed Type (Single, Double, Suite), and Room Number (assigned dynamically).
The room price is also entered manually in the Price field, but this could be dynamically calculated based on selected room preferences in a real system.
Confirmation:

When the "Alot Room" button is clicked, a confirmation dialog is shown, saying "Room Alloted Successfully".
Clear Button:

The "Clear" button resets all the fields, allowing for a fresh input.
Enhancements:
Room Availability: Currently, room numbers are not dynamically populated. This feature can be added by linking the combo box with available room data from a database or a predefined list.

Price Calculation: The price field can be made dynamic based on the selected room and bed type, factoring in extra charges or discounts.

Input Validation: Add checks to ensure that user inputs (such as mobile number, email, and price) are in the correct format.

# Customer Check-In System

This project implements a **Customer Check-In System** using **Java Swing**. The form allows hotel staff to input customer details, allocate rooms, and confirm check-ins. It includes options for customers to provide personal information, select room types, and receive an allotment of a room with a confirmation message.

## Features:
- **Customer Information:**
  - Name, Mobile Number, Nationality, Gender, Email
  - ID Proof and Address
- **Room Information:**
  - Room Type, Bed Type, Room Number, Price
- **Buttons:**
  - **Clear**: Resets all input fields.
  - **Alot Room**: Displays a success message indicating the room has been allocated.

## Components:
- **Swing Components**:
  - `JTextField`: For text input fields (e.g., Name, Mobile Number, Email).
  - `JComboBox`: For dropdown lists (e.g., Gender, Room Type, Bed Type).
  - `JLabel`: To display static text and icons.
  - `JButton`: Buttons for clearing and confirming room allotment.
  - `JOptionPane`: To show confirmation dialogs.
  
- **Layout**: The application uses the `AbsoluteLayout` for component positioning.

## How to Run:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK 8 or later is installed on your machine.
2. **IDE (Optional)**: You can use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to run the project.

### Steps to Run:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
